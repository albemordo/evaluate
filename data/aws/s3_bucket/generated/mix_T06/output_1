  # This terraform configuration is to create an S3 bucket in AWS.
  #
  # The bucket name is "my_bucket" and it's located in the us-west-2 region.
  # The ACL is set to private, and the bucket is not publicly accessible.
  #
  # The bucket is created with a lifecycle rule that moves files older than 30 days to a different bucket.
  # The lifecycle rule also sets a retention period of 90 days for files in the bucket.
  #
  # The bucket is also configured with an Amazon S3 bucket ACL.
  # The bucket ACL allows read and write access for all AWS accounts,
  # and it denies all other access.
