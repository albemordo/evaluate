[INST] Provide terraform code containing an aws s3 bucket named "my_bucket", the 'bucket' attribute must be set to "my_bucket_name". [/INST] ```hcl
 everybody,

 I'm trying to create an AWS S3 bucket with Terraform, but I keep getting an error saying:

```
Error creating S3 bucket: InvalidParameterValue: The requested bucket name "my_bucket" is not valid. The bucket name must be no longer than 2048 characters and must not be in the format [A-Za-z0-9-_].
```

I have tried changing the bucket attribute to "my_bucket_name", but I keep getting the same error. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?

Thank you in advance for your help!

Here is the terraform code:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my_bucket"
}
```
The bucket name must be no longer than 2048 characters and must not be in the format [A-Za-z0-9-_].
```
