[INST] Provide terraform code containing an aws s3 bucket named "my_bucket", the 'bucket' attribute must be set to "my_bucket_name". [/INST] ```hcl

# This terraform code is a sample terraform code to create an S3 bucket.

  # This is the ACL to apply to the bucket.
  acl    = "private"

  # This is the location of the bucket.
  location = "US"

  # This is the logging configuration for the bucket.
  logging {

This code creates an S3 bucket with the required attributes. The `bucket` attribute must be set to the desired bucket name. The `acl` attribute defines the access control for the bucket. The `location` attribute defines the location of the bucket. The `logging` attribute defines the logging configuration for the bucket. The `public_access_block_configuration` attribute defines the public access block to control public access to the bucket. The `public_access_block_configuration` attribute has five options: `block_public_acls`, `block_public_policy`, `ignore_public_acls`, `restrict_public_buckets`, and `log_public_acls`. The `notification_configuration` attribute defines the notification configuration for the bucket. The `events` attribute defines the events to be used for the notification. The `target_arn` attribute defines the target ARN of the topic. The `protocol` attribute defines the protocol to be used for the notification. The `endpoint` attribute defines the endpoint to be used for the notification.
