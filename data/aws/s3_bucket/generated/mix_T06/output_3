[INST] Provide terraform code containing an aws s3 bucket named "my_bucket", the 'bucket' attribute must be set to "my_bucket_name". [/INST] ```hcl
 nobody cares about your bucket name, set the bucket attribute to the actual bucket name.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my_bucket_name"
}
```
