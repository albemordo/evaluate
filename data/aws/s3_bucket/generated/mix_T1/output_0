[INST] Provide terraform code containing an aws s3 bucket named "my_bucket", the 'bucket' attribute must be set to "my_bucket_name". [/INST] ```hcl

# This terraform file gives you an example of how to create a Terraform
# resource. A resource is used to define the infrastructure that you
# want to create. You can define resources as either a Terraform
# resource or as a local, ad-hoc resource, depending on your needs.

# In this example, we're creating a resource of type aws_s3_bucket. This
# resource is used to create an S3 bucket in AWS. The "name" argument is
# used to specify the name of the bucket, and the "bucket" argument is
# used to specify the name of the bucket in a more specific manner. The
# "bucket" argument must be set to "my_bucket_name". In the example,
# "my_bucket_name" is "my-bucket".

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  # name = "my_bucket"
  # bucket = "my-bucket"   # this is wrong
  bucket = "my_bucket_name"
}
```
