# Create a new AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-3"
}

# Create a new AWS load balancer
resource "aws_lb" "x" {
  name               = "my-lb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  
  # The backend set contains all the instances that this load balancer should forward traffic to
  backend {
    instance_port     = 80
    instance_ip       = "10.0.0.1"
    lb_port           = 80
    lb_protocol       = "http"
  }

  # The security group is used to control access to the load balancer
  security_groups = [
    "sg-1234567890"

  # The subnets are the VPC subnets that the load balancer will be created in
