[INST] Provide terraform code containing just the aws provider in the region "eu-west-3". [/INST] ```hcl
 hopefully this is what you are looking for:

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-3"
}
```
This will create a new AWS provider with the specified region. You can then use this provider to create resources in your Terraform code.
