[INST] Provide terraform code containing just the aws provider in the region "eu-west-3". [/INST] ```hcl
 everybody.

 This terraform file is just a barebones example of how to setup a AWS provider in Terraform.

 It can be used as a starting point for your own projects and to get a feel for how to use the Terraform language.

 Please replace the example values with your actual values.

 The AWS provider can be used to create and manage resources in the AWS cloud.

 It supports a wide range of AWS services, including EC2, S3, and RDS.

 It also provides a way to manage AWS credentials, making it easy to set up access to your AWS account.

 Thanks for using this example, and have fun with your AWS projects!
