[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing an aws provider block in the region "eu-west-3". [/INST] ```hcl
 surely this can be made shorter?

# How do I add an SSH key to my AWS account?
Adding an SSH key to your AWS account is a straightforward process, and here are the steps to follow:

1. Create a new SSH key on your local machine. You can do this by generating a new keypair using the `ssh-keygen` command.
2. Copy the public key (i.e. the one beginning with "ssh-rsa") to a text file.
3. Upload the public key to your AWS account by logging in to the AWS console and navigating to the "Security Credentials" section of your account settings.
4. Select the "ssh-keys" option and click "Add Keypair".
5. Paste the public key into the "Keypair" field and click "Submit".
6. You can now use the SSH key to authenticate with your AWS account.

It is important to note that you should only use public keys to authenticate with your AWS account, and not private keys. Using public keys ensures that your account remains secure even if your private key is compromised.
