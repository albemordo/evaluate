[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing an aws provider block in the region "eu-west-3". [/INST] ```hcl
 hopefully, this will get you started:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-3"
}
```
This block of code creates an AWS provider with the necessary credentials. It then sets the region where the instance is located. You can change this as necessary.
