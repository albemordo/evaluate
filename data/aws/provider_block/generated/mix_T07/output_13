[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing an aws provider block in the region "eu-west-3". [/INST] ```hcl
 everybody can see it, so here is the example:

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-3"
}

The region needs to be replaced with your region.

You can also provide a list of additional tags in the "tags" attribute.

```hcl
# terraform

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-3"
  tags = {
    environment = "dev"
    name = "myapp"
  }
}
```
