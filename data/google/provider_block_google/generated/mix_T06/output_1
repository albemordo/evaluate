[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing just the google provider block for the project "my_project" and in the region "us-central1". [/INST] ```hcl
 hopefully this is enough to get you started. You can then add more configurations for the project and region if needed.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "my_project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```
