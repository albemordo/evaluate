[INST] Provide terraform hcl code with just a google compute instance resource named "my_instance". The machine type is "n2-standard-2" and the zone is "us-central1-a".
The boot_disk image must be set to "debian-cloud/debian-11". Also set up a network interface inside the resource, the network is "default". [/INST] ```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "my_instance" {
  name           = "my_instance"
  machine_type   = "n2-standard-2"
  zone           = "us-central1-a"
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
    }
  }
  network_interface {
    network = "default"
