[INST] Provide terraform hcl code with just a google compute instance resource named "my_instance". The machine type is "n2-standard-2" and the zone is "us-central1-a".
The boot_disk image must be set to "debian-cloud/debian-11". Also set up a network interface inside the resource, the network is "default". [/INST]
# This file has some scaffolding to make sure that names are unique and that
# a region and zone are selected when you try to create your Terraform resources.
