[INST] Retrieve terraform code for a google compute network and a google compute subnetwork resources.

The google compute network is named vpc and has disabled the flag "auto_create_subnetworks".

The google compute subnetworks is named subnetwork, is on the region "us-central1", has ip cidr range set to "10.2.0.0/16" and its network is linked to the vpc id. [/INST] ```hcl
variable "region" {}
variable "name" {}
variable "cidr" {}

provider "google" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "google_compute_network" "vpc" {
  name                    = "${var.name}"
  auto_create_subnetworks = "false"
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnetwork" {
  name                     = "${var.name}-subnetwork"
  ip_cidr_range            = "${var.cidr}"
  region                   = "${var.region}"
  network                  = "${google_compute_network.vpc.self_link}"
