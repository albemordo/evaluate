[INST] Provide terraform code containing an azurerm infrastructure.
First, create the azurerm provider with empty features ({}) block.
Then provision an azurerm resource group named "my_resgroup" and located in "West Europe".
Then, provide an azurerm virtual network is named "my_vpc" and the address_space attribute is a list containing just "10.0.0.0/16". The location is linked with my_resgroup's location and the resource group name is linked with my_resgroup's name.
Finally, provide an azurerm subnet named "my_subnet", having adress previxes with just "10.0.1.0/24". The resource group name is linked to my_resgroup's name, while the virtual network name is linked to my_vpc's name.  [/INST] ```hcl
