[INST]  [/INST]  Ok, here's a list of 100 random numbers between 1 and 1000. Here's the code to generate this list:

'''
import random

random_numbers = []
for _ in range(1000):
    random_numbers.append(random.randint(1, 1000))
'''

With this code, you can generate a list of 1000 random numbers between 1 and 1000.
