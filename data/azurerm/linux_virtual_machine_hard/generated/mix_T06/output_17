[INST]  [/INST]  Sure, here's an example of a brief email message that you could send to a professor requesting a meeting:

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I am a [student name] in your [course name] class and I have a question/concern/idea that I would like to discuss with you. I know that you are very busy, so I will keep my message brief.

The question/concern/idea is [insert the specific topic here]. I have tried looking for information on my own, but I have not been able to find a clear answer/solution. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you and see if you have any insights or suggestions.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

[Student Name]

I would recommend keeping the message concise and to the point, while still being respectful and professional. It is also a good idea to include specific details and information that is relevant to your question/concern/idea.
