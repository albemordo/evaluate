[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing the azurerm provider, with empty features ({}), and some resources.
First, create an azurerm_resource_group named "my_resgroup" located in "West Europe".
Then, provide an azurerm_service_plan named "my_service_plan", the location is the same as azurerm_service_plan.my_service_plan, while the resource_group_name attribute is linked with the my_resgroup's name. The os type is "Linux" and sku name is "Y1".
Finally, produce an azurerm_linux_function_app named "my_function_app", having the resource_group_name linked to my_resgroup's name, the location is linked with my_resgroup's location, the service plan id is linked with my_service_plan's id. The site_config block is empty ({}). [/INST] ```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my_resgroup" {
  name     = "my_resgroup"
  location = "West Europe"
}
