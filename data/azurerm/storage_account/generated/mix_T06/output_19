[INST] Provide terraform hcl to provision an azurerm infrastructure:
First, the azurerm provider must have empty features ({}) block.
Then, create an azurerm resource group named "my_resgrup", located in "West Europe".
Finally, provide an azurerm storage account named "my_storage_account", having resource_group_name linked with my_resgrup's name and location linked with my_resgrup's location. The account tier is Standard and the account replication type is GRS. [/INST] ```hcl
# This terraform configuration creates an Azure Resource Group and a Storage Account

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my_resgrup" {
  name     = "my_resgrup"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "my_storage_account" {
  name                     = "my_storage_account"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.my_resgrup.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.my_resgrup.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
}
```
