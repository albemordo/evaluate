[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing just the azurerm provider with empty features ({}). [/INST] Sure, here's an example of a barebones terraform configuration for the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provider. It includes the minimum required provider configuration and no other features:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

This configuration will set up the necessary provider for managing Azure resources and will not enable any additional features. It is a good starting point for small-scale projects where you don't need any additional provider features.
