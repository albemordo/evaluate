[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing just the azurerm provider with empty features ({}). [/INST] Sure, here is a simple example of a Terraform configuration file that includes only the `azurerm` provider and empty features:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

This configuration will initialize the Azure Resource Manager (Azurerm) provider and configure it with no features. This is a simple example to get started with Terraform and managing Azure resources.
