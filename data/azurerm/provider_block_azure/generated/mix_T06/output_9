[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing just the azurerm provider with empty features ({}). [/INST] Sure, here's an example of a Terraform configuration file that only includes the `azurerm` provider with empty features:

```terraform
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

This configuration file is a minimal example that only sets up the `azurerm` provider. It does not include any other provider or configuration options.
