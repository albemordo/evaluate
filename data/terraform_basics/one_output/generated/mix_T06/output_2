[INST] Provide terraform hcl code containing a single output block named 'hello_world', the value should be "Hello World!". [/INST] ```hcl
Terraform code:

```hcl
output "hello_world" {
  value = "Hello World!"
}
```

This is a simple example of a Terraform output block. The `output` block is used to declare a variable that will be outputted when the terraform resource is applied. In this case, the variable is `hello_world` and its value is `Hello World!`.
