[INST] Provide a terraform hcl configuration containing a variable named 'one_variable' of type string, then set its value to 'content'. [/INST] ```hcl
 everybody is saying that

```hcl
variable "one_variable" {
  type = "string"
  default = "content"
}
```

is bad.

```hcl
variable "one_variable" {
  type = "string"
  default = "content"
}
```

is good.

But I can't see the difference. Can you explain it to me?
