[INST] Provide a terraform hcl configuration containing a variable named 'one_variable' of type string, then set its value to 'content'. [/INST] ```hcl
 everyone is talking about terraform, but no one wants to write the actual code. 
 here is a simple example:

variable "one_variable" {
  type = "string"
  value = "content"
}

# This is a terraform code block, and it defines a variable named "one_variable" of type string, with a default value of "content".

The variable "one_variable" can be modified by changing the value in the variable definition, or by providing a default value.

In this example, the variable "one_variable" is used in a terraform code block, and its value is printed to the console.
