[INST] Retrieve terraform code for a google compute network and a google compute subnetwork resources.

The google compute network is named vpc and has disabled the flag "auto_create_subnetworks".

The google compute subnetworks is named subnetwork, is on the region "us-central1", has ip cidr range set to "10.2.0.0/16" and its network is linked to the vpc id. [/INST] ```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc" {
  name                    = "vpc"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnetwork" {
  name          = "subnetwork"
  ip_cidr_range = "10.2.0.0/16"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.id
}
